# Cleanflight

![Cleanflight](docs/assets/cleanflight/cleanflight-logo-light-wide-1-240px.jpg)

Cleanflight is flight controller software for multi-rotor and fixed wings.  The cleanflight project, and related projects such as betaflight and iNav are
used on the majority of flight controllers used around the world.  There is no other software used on as many flight-controllers!

* If you're looking for cutting edge performance and don't mind doing your homework, checkout the betaflight fork.
* If you're looking for advanced navigation features then check out the iNav fork.
* All other users should use cleanflight.

Features:

* Support for modern STM32 based processors F1/F3/F4/F7.
* Support for modern accelerometer/gyro/barometer/compass sensors.
* Support for modern ESC technologies DSHOT/ONESHOT and legacy PWM.
* Support for Multi-color RGB LED strip support.
* Advanced on-board telemetry logging (Blackbox).
* Wide support of receivers (SBus/iBus/SumD/SumH/PPM/PWM)
* Wide support of telemetry protocols (FrSky/SmartPort/S.Port/HoTT/iBus/LTM).
* Built-in OSD support & configuration without needing third-party OSD software/firmware/comm devices.
* VTX support (RTC6705/Unify Pro/IRC Tramp/etc).
* and MUCH, MUCH more.

## IRC Support and Developers Channel

There's a dedicated Cleanflight IRC channel on the Freenode IRC network. Many users and some of the developers frequent there, and it is a helpful and friendly community - but there are two important things to keep in mind: First and most importantly, please go ahead and ask if you have questions, but **make sure you wait around long enough for a reply**. Next, sometimes people are out flying, asleep or at work and can't answer immediately, even though they are present in the channel. This is how IRC works: Many people stay logged in, even though they are not actively participating in the discussion all the time. Have a seat, grab a drink and hang around if it's a quiet time of day.

If you are using Windows and don't have an IRC client installed, take a look at [HydraIRC](http://hydrairc.com/).

There's a dedicated Slack chat channel for betaflight here:

http://www.betaflight.tk/

Etiquette: Don't ask to ask and please wait around long enough for a reply - sometimes people are out flying, asleep or at work and can't answer immediately.

## Videos

There is a dedicated Cleanflight YouTube channel which has progress update videos, flight demonstrations, instructions and other related videos.

Please subscribe and '+1' the videos if you find them useful.
