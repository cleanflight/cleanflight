# Cleanflight

Clean-code version of baseflight flight-controller - flight controllers are used to fly multi-rotor craft and fixed wing craft.

This fork differs from baseflight in that it attempts to use modern software development practices which result in:

1. greater reliability through code robustness and automated testing. 
2. easier maintainance through code cleanliness.
3. easier to develop new features. 
4. easier to re-use code though code de-coupling and modularisation.

The MultiWii software, from which baseflight originated, violates many good software development best-practices. Hopefully this fork will go some way to address them. If you see any bad code in this fork please immediately raise an issue so it can be fixed, or better yet submit a pull request.

## Additional Features

Cleanflight also has additional features not found in baseflight.  Since the primary maintainer of baseflight also sells hardware there is no incentive for baseflight to support the target platforms and features that Cleanflight now provides.

For a list of features, changes and some discussion please review the thread on MultiWii forums and consult the documenation.
