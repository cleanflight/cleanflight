/**
 * MSP Guidelines, emphasis is used to clarify.
 *
 * Each FlightController (FC, Server) MUST change the API version when any MSP command is added, deleted, or changed.
 *
 * If you fork the FC source code and release your own version, you MUST change the Flight Controller Identifier.
 *
 * NEVER release a modified copy of this code that shares the same Flight controller IDENT and API version
 * if the API doesn't match EXACTLY.
 *
 * Consumers of the API (API clients) SHOULD first attempt to get a response from the MSP_API_VERSION command.
 * If no response is obtained then client MAY try the legacy MSP_IDENT command.
 *
 * API consumers should ALWAYS handle communication failures gracefully and attempt to continue
 * without the information if possible.  Clients MAY log/display a suitable message.
 *
 * API clients should NOT attempt any communication if they can't handle the returned API MAJOR VERSION.
 *
 * API clients SHOULD attempt communication if the API MINOR VERSION has increased from the time
 * the API client was written and handle command failures gracefully.  Clients MAY disable
 * functionality that depends on the commands while still leaving other functionality intact.
 * Clients SHOULD operate in READ-ONLY mode and SHOULD present a warning to the user to state
 * that the newer API version may cause problems before using API commands that change FC state.
 *
 * It is for this reason that each MSP command should be specific as possible, such that changes
 * to commands break as little client functionality as possible.
 *
 * API client authors MAY use a compatibility matrix/table when determining if they can support
 * a given command from a given flight controller at a given api version level.
 *
 * Developers MUST NOT create new MSP commands that do more than one thing.
 *
 * Failure to follow these guidelines will likely invoke the wrath of developers trying to write tools
 * that use the API and the users of those tools.
