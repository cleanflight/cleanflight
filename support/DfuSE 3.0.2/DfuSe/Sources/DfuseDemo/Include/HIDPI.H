// Notes:
//
// ReportCount:  When a report descriptor declares an Input, Output, or
// Feature main item with fewer usage declarations than the report count, then
// the last usage applies to all remaining unspecified count in that main item.
// (As an example you might have data that required many fields to describe,
// possibly buffered bytes.)  In this case, only one value cap structure is
// allocated for these associtated fields, all with the same usage, and Report
// Count reflects the number of fields involved.  Normally ReportCount is 1.
//

//
// The link collection tree consists of an array of LINK_COLLECTION_NODES
// where the index into this array is the same as the collection number.
//
// Given a collection A which contains a subcollection B, A is defined to be
// the parent B, and B is defined to be the child.
//
// Given collections A, B, and C where B and C are children of A, and B was
// encountered before C in the report descriptor, B is defined as a sibling of
// C.  (This implies, of course, that if B is a sibling of C, then C is NOT a
// sibling of B).
//
// B is defined as the NextSibling of C if and only if there exists NO
// child collection of A, call it D, such that B is a sibling of D and D
// is a sibling of C.
//
// E is defined to be the FirstChild of A if and only if for all children of A,
// F, that are not equivalent to E, F is a sibling of E.
// (This implies, of course, that the does not exist a child of A, call it G,
// where E is a sibling of G).  In other words the first sibling is the last
// link collection found in the list.
//
// With that in mind, the following describes conclusively a data structure
// that provides direct traversal up, down, and accross the link collection
// tree.

Routine Description:
   This function sets binary values (buttons) in the report.  Given an

   each element in the given list of usages has been set in the report packet.
   For example, in an output report with 5 LED뭩, each with a given usage,
   an application could turn on any subset of these lights by placing their
   usages in any order into the byte array (usageList).  HidP_SetUsage would,
   in turn, set the appropriate bit or add the corresponding byte into the
   HID Main Array Item.

   UsagePage  All of the usages in the usage array, which HidP_SetUsage will

Routine Description:
This function returns the binary values (buttons) in a HID report.
Given a report packet of correct length, it searches the report packet

Parameters:

   UsagePage  All of the usages in the usage array, which HidP_SetUsage will
              retrieve in the report, refer to this same usage page.
              If the client wishes to get usages in a packet for multiple
              usage pages then that client needs to make subsequent getUsages
              calls.

   UsageList  A byte array containing the usages that HidP_GetUsage found in
              the report packet.

   UsageLength The length of the given byte array.
               This value initially describes the length of the usage list,
               but HidP_GetUsage sets this value to the length of found usages.
