#3D Setup

When FEATURE 3D is enabled,either by the configuration GUI or CLI command, it allows operation with bi-directional escs to provide inverted as well as normal,upright operation. 

##Setup:

* Enable **FEATURE 3D** in the firmware

* Setup ESC to **BIDIRECTIONAL** (norm/reverse/birectional slider in BLHeli GUI) and set **esc max pwm** in the ESC GUI to the maximum your transmitter outputs on the throttle channel (normally 2000us) and **esc min pwm** to the minimum (normally 1000us) and the **midpoint** to halfway between (normally 1500us). You can determine what your TX outputs by using the **Reciever** tab in the configurator.

* Setup the following parameters in the CLI:

 **3d_deadband_high**: (typically 1550) lowest value for upright throttle output when armed, highest is max_throttle 

 **3d_deadband_low**: (typically 1450) lowest value for inverted throttle output when armed, highest is mincommand 

                 (Note: switchover point for upright or inverted is **midrc** on throttle stick)

 **3d_neutral**: (typically 1500) same effect as mincommand, but for 3d operation...ie disarmed pulsewidth to escs 

 **3d_deadband_throttle**: (typically 50) throttle stick range around midrc for allowing arming to occur 

 **maxthrottle**= max tx output (typically 2000us)

 **mincommand** = min tx output (typically 1000us)

* Set a TX switch to control arming and set this up in the Mode tab of the configuration GUI


Motor_stop and stick arming do **NOT** work in 3D mode for obvious safety issues. Arming will only occur when the throttle stick is centered (=/- **3d_deadband_throttle**) and the ARMing switch is active. The motors will immediately spin at **3d_deadband_low or _high**, depending on throttle position above or below **midrc**. Full power reverse will be at low stick and full power normal will be at full high stick. De-activating the ARMing switch will stop motors immediately independent of throttle stick position.

You will need to set the proper rotation for each motor by wiring order for the motor.

3D props are highly recommended to get reasonable and equal power inverted or upright.

Finally, using a TX throttle curve to tailor the shape of throttle output above and below midstick to soften sensitivy at the hover points, above and below, will probably be needed, since the stick sensitivity is effectively doubled since only one half is used on each side.
