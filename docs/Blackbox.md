# Blackbox flight data recorder

![Rendered flight log frame](Screenshots/blackbox-screenshot-1.jpg)

## Introduction

This feature transmits your flight data information on every control loop iteration over a serial port to an external
logging device to be recorded, or to a dataflash chip which is present on some flight controllers.

After your flight, you can process the resulting logs on your computer to either turn them into CSV (comma-separated
values) or render your flight log as a video using the tools `blackbox_decode` and `blackbox_render`. Those tools can be
found in this repository:

https://github.com/cleanflight/blackbox-tools

You can also view your flight logs using your web browser with the interactive log viewer:

## Logged data
The blackbox records flight data on every iteration of the flight control loop. It records the current time in
microseconds, P, I and D corrections for each axis, your RC command stick positions (after applying expo curves),
gyroscope data, accelerometer data (after your configured low-pass filtering), barometer readings, 3-axis magnetometer
readings, raw VBAT and current measurements, and the command being sent to each motor speed controller. This is all
stored without any approximation or loss of precision, so even quite subtle problems should be detectable from the fight
data log.

GPS data is logged whenever new GPS data is available. Although the CSV decoder will decode this data, the video
renderer does not yet show any of the GPS information (this will be added later).

## Supported configurations

The maximum data rate that can be recorded to the flight log is fairly restricted, so anything that increases the load
can cause the flight log to drop frames and contain errors.

The Blackbox was developed and tested on a quadcopter. It has also been tested on a tricopter. It should work on
hexacopters or octocopters, but as they transmit more information to the flight log (due to having more motors), the 
number of dropped frames may increase. The `blackbox_render` tool only supports tri and quadcopters (please send me 
flight logs from other craft, and I can add support for them!)

Cleanflight's `looptime` setting will decide how many times per second an update is saved to the flight log. The
software was developed on a craft with a looptime of 2400. Any looptime smaller than this will put more strain on the
data rate. The default looptime on Cleanflight is 3500. If you're using a looptime of 2000 or smaller, you will probably
need to reduce the sampling rate in the Blackbox settings, see the later section on configuring the Blackbox feature for
details.

## Hardware

There are two options for storing your flight logs. You can either transmit the log data over a serial port to an 
external logging device like the [OpenLog serial data logger][] to be recorded to a microSDHC card, or if you have a
compatible flight controller you can store the logs on the onboard dataflash storage instead.

### OpenLog serial data logger

The OpenLog ships with standard OpenLog 3 firmware installed. However, in order to reduce the number of dropped frames,
it should be reflashed with the [OpenLog Light firmware][] or the special [OpenLog Blackbox firmware][] . The Blackbox
variant of the firmware ensures that the OpenLog is running at the correct baud-rate and does away for the need for a 
`CONFIG.TXT` file to set up the OpenLog.

You can find the Blackbox version of the OpenLog firmware [here](https://github.com/cleanflight/blackbox-firmware), 
along with instructions for installing it onto your OpenLog.

#### microSDHC

Your choice of microSDHC card is very important to the performance of the system. The OpenLog relies on being able to
make many small writes to the card with minimal delay, which not every card is good at. A faster SD-card speed rating is
not a guarantee of better performance.

##### microSDHC cards known to have poor performance

 - Generic 4GB Class 4 microSDHC card - the rate of missing frames is about 1%, and is concentrated around the most
   interesting parts of the log!

##### microSDHC cards known to have good performance

 - Transcend 16GB Class 10 UHS-I microSDHC (typical error rate < 0.1%)
 - Sandisk Extreme 16GB Class 10 UHS-I microSDHC (typical error rate < 0.1%)

You should format any card you use with the [SD Association's special formatting tool][] , as it will give the OpenLog
the best chance of writing at high speed. You must format it with either FAT, or with FAT32 (recommended).

#### OpenLog configuration

This section applies only if you are using the OpenLog or OpenLog Light original firmware on the OpenLog. If you flashed
it with the special OpenLog Blackbox firmware, you don't need to configure it further.

Power up the OpenLog with a microSD card inside, wait 10 seconds or so, then power it down and plug the microSD card
into your computer. You should find a "CONFIG.TXT" file on the card. Edit it in a text editor to set the first number
(baud) to 115200. Set esc# to 0, mode to 0, and echo to 0. Save the file and put the card back into your OpenLog, it
should use those settings from now on.

If your OpenLog didn't write a CONFIG.TXT file, create a CONFIG.TXT file with these contents and store it in the root
of the MicroSD card:

```
115200,26,0,0,1,0,1
baud,escape,esc#,mode,verb,echo,ignoreRX
```

#### Serial port

A 115200 baud serial port is required to connect the OpenLog to your flight controller (such as `serial_port_1` on the
Naze32, the two-pin Tx/Rx header in the center of the board). The Blackbox can not be used with softserial ports as they
are too slow.

Connect the "TX" pin of the serial port you've chosen to the OpenLog's "RXI" pin. Don't connect the serial port's RX
pin to the OpenLog.

#### Protection

The OpenLog can be wrapped in black electrical tape or heat-shrink in order to insulate it from conductive frames (like
carbon fiber), but this makes its status LEDs impossible to see. I recommend wrapping it with some clear heatshrink
tubing instead.

### Onboard dataflash storage
The full version of the Naze32 has an onboard "m25p16" 2 megayte dataflash storage chip which can be used to store
flight logs instead of using an OpenLog. This is the small chip at the base of the Naze32's direction arrow. 
This chip is not present on the "Acro" version of the Naze32.

## Enabling the Blackbox (CLI)
In the [Cleanflight Configurator][] , enter the CLI tab. Enable the Blackbox feature by typing in `feature BLACKBOX` and
pressing enter. Now choose the device that you want to log to:

### OpenLog serial data logger
Enter `set blackbox_device=0` to switch to logging to a serial port (this is the default).

You then need to let Cleanflight know which of [your serial ports][] you connected the OpenLog to. A 115200 baud port
is required (such as `serial_port_1` on the Naze32, the two-pin Tx/Rx header in the center of the board).

For example, use `set serial_port_1_scenario=11` to switch the main serial port to MSP, CLI, Blackbox and GPS
Passthrough. You can also use the GUI to configure a port for the Blackbox feature on the Ports tab.

### Onboard dataflash
Enter `set blackbox_device=1` to switch to logging to an onboard dataflash chip, if your flight controller has one.

## Configuring the Blackbox

The Blackbox currently provides two settings (`blackbox_rate_num` and `blackbox_rate_denom`) that allow you to control 
the rate at which data is logged. These two together form a fraction (`blackbox_rate_num / blackbox_rate_denom`) which
decides what portion of the flight controller's control loop iterations should be logged. The default is 1/1 which logs 
every iteration.

If you are using a short looptime like 2000 or faster, or you're using a slower MicroSD card, you will need to reduce
this rate to reduce the number of corrupted logged frames that `blackbox_decode` complains about. A rate of 1/2 is likely
to work for most craft.

You can change these settings by entering the CLI tab in the [Cleanflight Configurator][] and using the `set` command, like so:

```
set blackbox_rate_num = 1
set blackbox_rate_denom = 2
```

The data rate for my quadcopter using a looptime of 2400 and a rate of 1/1 is about 10.25kB/s. This allows about 18
days of flight logs to fit on my OpenLog's 16GB MicroSD card, which ought to be enough for anybody :).

If you're logging to an onboard dataflash chip instead of an OpenLog, be aware that the 2MB of storage space it offers
is pretty small. At the default 1/1 logging rate, and a 2400 looptime, this is only enough for about 3 minutes of
flight. This could be long enough for you to investigate some flying problem with your craft, but you may want to reduce
the logging rate in order to extend your recording time.

To maximize your recording time, you could drop the rate way down to 1/32 (the smallest possible rate) which would
result in a logging rate of about 10-20Hz and about 650 bytes/second of data. At that logging rate, the 2MB flash chip
can store around 50 minutes of flight data, though the level of detail is severely reduced and you could not diagnose
flight problems like vibration or PID setting issues.

## Usage

The Blackbox starts recording data as soon as you arm your craft, and stops when you disarm.

If your craft has a buzzer attached, a short beep will be played when you arm and recording begins. You can later use
this beep to synchronize your recorded flight video with the rendered flight data log (the beep is shown as a blue line
in the flight data log, which you can sync against the beep in your recorded audio track).

You should wait a few seconds after disarming your craft to allow the Blackbox to finish saving its data.

### Usage - OpenLog
Each time the OpenLog is power-cycled, it begins a fresh new log file. If you arm and disarm several times without
cycling the power (recording several flights), those logs will be combined together into one file. The command line
tools will ask you to pick which one of these flights you want to display/decode.

Don't insert or remove the SD card while the OpenLog is powered up.

### Usage - Dataflash chip
After your flights, you can use the [Cleanflight Configurator][] to download the contents of the dataflash to your
computer. Go to the "dataflash" tab and click the "save flash to file..." button. Saving the log can take 2 or 3
minutes.

![Dataflash tab in Configurator](Screenshots/blackbox-dataflash.png)

After downloading the log, be sure to erase the chip to make it ready for reuse by clicking the "erase flash" button.
If you try to start recording a new flight when the dataflash is already full, the Blackbox will not make its regular
arming beep and nothing will be recorded.

## Converting logs to CSV or PNG
After your flights, you'll have a series of flight log files with a .TXT extension. You'll need to decode these with
the `blackbox_decode` tool to create CSV (comma-separated values) files for analysis, or render them into a series of PNG
frames with `blackbox_render` tool, which you could then convert into a video using another software package.

You'll find those tools along with instructions for using them in this repository:

https://github.com/cleanflight/blackbox-tools

You can also view your .TXT flight log files interactively using your web browser with the Cleanflight Blackbox Explorer
tool:
