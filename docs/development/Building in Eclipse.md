## Extended Notes

### Install the JDK

The [minimum JDK version](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/plugins/install/#java) supported by GNU Arm Eclipse is 1.7 but the current latest, 1.8, is recommended instead. While Oracle JDK is the recommended version, [they do also support](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/plugins/install/#java) the OpenJDK.

### Install Eclipse

Eclipse Luna v4.4 is the preferred version for GNU Arm Tools currently. The minimum Eclipse version is Kepler 4.3. The maximum is Mars 4.5 although it is not tested by GNU Arm Eclipse and some things are [known to be broken](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/plugins/install/#eclipse--cdt). Eclipse Neon is currently not released.

CDT v8.6.0, as shipped in the Eclipse Luna CDT download, is recommended. The minimum CDT version is 8.3.

The 64bit Eclipse is preferred but a 32bit Eclipse can be used; ensure you run it on a 32bit JDK.

### Install ARM Toolchain

The minimum version is 4.8-2014-q2. The maximum, and currently recommended version, is 4_9-2015q3.

GNU ARM Tools recommends that you don't add the toolchain to your path environment variable. This means you can install multiple versions of the toolchain without conflict. If you'll install only one version, it can make life easier when working outside Eclipse to add it to your path.

Retain the default installation directories so that the GNU ARM Plugins can locate the toolchain.

### Install OpenOCD

You should install OpenOCD If you will be debugging on real hardware, such as the STM32F3DISCOVERY dev board. It is not required to simply build Cleanflight or run the tests.

### Install QEMU

No tests currently run on the QEMU emulator therefore this install is entirely optional. It is useful to test your installation, since you can compile and run a blinky demo.

### Checkout Cleanflight

If you'll be submitting changes to cleanflight, [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on GitHub and checkout your copy.

In Eclipse go to *File -> Import* choose *Git -> Projects from Git*

![projects from git](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-001.PNG)

Choose *Clone URI*

![clone uri](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-002.PNG)

Enter the URI https://github.com/cleanflight/cleanflight or if you've forked the repo, enter your URI instead. With a fork, you will need to specify your authentication details

![enter uri](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-003.PNG)

On the branch selection dialog, de-select all branches and select only *master*

![choose branches to clone](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-004.PNG)

Select the default destination directory

![destination](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-005.PNG)

When the download completes, choose *Use the New Project wizard* and click Finish

![finish](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-006.PNG)

Choose *C/C++ -> Makefile Project with Existing Code*

![makefile project](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-007.PNG)

Enter cleanflight as the project name and browse to your home directory -> git -> cleanflight for the existing code location. Ensure the C (cleanflight) and C++ (tests) languages are checked. Choose the Cross ARM GCC toolchain for the Indexer Settings. Click finish.

![finish checkout](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-008.PNG)

Set your build and debug targets by going to project properties -> C/C++ Build and choose the Behaviour tab. Replace "all" in the build box with "TARGET=xxx DEBUG=GDB" where xxx is your platform such as NAZE

![build](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-012.PNG)

On Windows only, add msys or cygwin bin directory to the project's path by right clicking the project and choosing properties

![properties](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-009.PNG)

Edit the path variable in *C/C++ Build -> Environment*

![edit path](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-010.PNG)

Append the full path to the relevant bin dir

![append bin dir](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-011.PNG)

### Build

Choose project -> build all

![build all](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-013.PNG)

### Configure Debugging

Choose debug -> debug configurations

![debug configurations](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-014.PNG)

Create a new OpenOCD configuration for the obj\main\cleanflight_XXX.elf application (this file is generated by the build step above)

![debug configurations](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-015.PNG)

Add the appropriate openocd board configuration parameter for your dev platform

![openocd target](assets/building-in-eclipse/checkout-cleanflight-016.PNG)

Add the target to your debug menu favourites
