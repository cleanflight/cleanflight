#Building Manual.

The manual PDF file is generated by concatenating relevant markdown files and by transforming the result using Gimli to obtain the final PDF file. This steps are handled automatically by the ```build_manual.sh``` script located in the root of the repository next to the Makefile.

##Requrements & Installation
The PDF manual generation uses the Gimli for the conversion. It can be installed via ruby gems. On Debian based systems the installation steps are:
```bash
    sudo aptitude install rubygems wkhtmltopdf libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
    sudo gem1.8 install gimli
```

##Configuration
All markdown files need to be registered in the ```build_manual.sh``` file individually by modifying the ```doc_files``` variable / array:
```bash
doc_files=( 'Configuration.md'
	'Board - CC3D.md'
	'...'
	'...'
)
```

##Restritions
As the conversion via Gimli will not respect embedded image's DPI settings, the diemnsions of the image will be defined by the physical resolution in pixels. As a rule of thumb one should not embedd images wider than 600px in the markdown files.
