# Installation

## Using configurator

Use the firmware flasher in the cleanflight configurator.

## Manually

# Upgrading

When upgrading be sure to backup / dump your existing settings.  Some firmware releases are not backwards compatible and default settings are restored when the FC detects an out of date configuration.

## Backup/Restore process

See the CLI section of the docs for details on how to backup and restore your configuration via the CLI.
